    "We have discussed in the lecture how decision trees can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this first example, we will build one for the classification of a binary outcome - churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn refers to whether a customer turns away from a company. It's an important measure that companies are interested in both assessing and predicting. For example, they might want to target customers who they think might \"leave\" with additional advertisting to keep them, or they might want to stop spending money on them early because they don't want to \"waste\" expenses on a customer who will leave anyway. In real life, you will often not only classify customers by their churn likelihood, but co-analyse churn in combination with profitability.\n",
