    "Start just like we did last week with a simple regression model with just one X variable. I recommend that you use the scikit learn function LogisticRegression() for that. Have a look at the documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) as that will help you get started. I typically first have a look at the parameters that the function takes, and then have a look at the implementation example. I then try to replicate that example with my data.\n",

    "As we first want to implement just a simple logistic regression, pick one independent variable as your predictor. You can choose any one of the available ones.\n",

    "One important parameter will be the **solver**. You will remember that we are looking for the best-fit parameters to fit our model to the data. The solver is the approach that the algorithm uses to achieve that. In this example, I would recommend using the 'liblinear' solver. It works best for smaller datasets, which we have here with just around 570 observations.\n",

You can use the [numpy reshape() function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) to change the format of it with y_class.values.reshape(-1,)"
