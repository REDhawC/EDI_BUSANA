    "**What makes a company more fair in terms of gender equality?** Look at the data about ownership/voting  - does this data behave differently for people of different genders, ages and nationalities? hint: We can sometimes deduce a person's gender from their title (Mr, Mrs) but not always (Dr); also company house offers a limited number of options and not everyone can find their preferred title/pronoun there. You could eg. compare companies with the word X and word Y in their name, or look at some other variable to see which companies are more diverse than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When's a good time to start a tourism business?** Looking at tourism-related companies, do you see patterns in years/months of creation and cessation (closing)? Are companies created at some times more likely to survive for longer? note: to get tourism-related companies, first fetch company details for many tourism words ['travel','trip','cruise',...] and then check their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the best place in UK to set up a fintech company?** Did it change over the years? Look at locations of companies in a sector, and where they are based. Does the count of companies, or the lengths of time they survive, change over time? Does it change differently in different locations? note: to get industry's companies you could use the method described above (using many words and filtering SIC codes)\n",
