      "Review: Lovely experience visiting the castle, got to see a Burns song recital, the cannon firing at 1pm and would highly recommend visiting in the morning on the weekend and precooking tickets, by the time we left after 1pm on a Saturday it was very busy! Seeing the honours and war memorial was fantastic as well as all the other parts of the castle. Recommend getting a map or audio tour to help you navigate it and having 3-4 hours dedicated to exploring.\n",

      "Review: Fantastic views and steeped in medieval history. We saw the Scottish Crown Jewels which were spectacular to see up close. The art work throughout the Crown jewel exhibition was beautiful telling the story of the Scottish Crown throughout the ages. There was one part where the paintings of each of the characters depicted slowly came out of the wall as you walked along with the final 2 or 3 being stand along sculptures; it was superb! The views were simply breathtaking at each of the different levels! Well worth a visit!\n",
