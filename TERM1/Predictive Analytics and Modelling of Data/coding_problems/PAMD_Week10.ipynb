    "### 1.3 Comparison of different SVM Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder how different Kernel choices impact the performance of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right Kernel for an SVM problem is a difficult task. In the majority of cases you will have to run different configurations and test them, comparing the performance and then choosing the best fit based on that. There are typically only two or three candidates which you would consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check back into the [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC) and note the different Kernel options you have. There's also a very good overview of [different Kernels](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_svm_kernels.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-svm-plot-svm-kernels-py) and their performance visualised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'rbf': the default. It stands for radial basis function and is a Gaussian Kernel. This is a very common Kernel shape in practice.\n",
    "- 'linear': Produces a linear SVC.\n",
    "- 'poly': Polynomial Kernel. You can then use the parameter 'degree' to change the degree of it, the default is set to 3. The parameter 'coef0' can then be used to shift data.\n",
    "- 'sigmoid' This Kernel is less commonly used as it has very specific use cases, where the data distribution can be approximated as a sigmoid shape, and it only fits those well. Again, 'coef0' can be used to shift data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a lot of these coefficients like 'coef0' we would use cross-validation (for example via [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV)) to find the optimal one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TASK**\n",
    "- Implement one or more SVMs, but this time specify the Kernel choice\n",
    "- Compare the performance to your model in 1.2 using accuracy and AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "The default in 1.2 was Gaussian (rbf), so you can compare the performance to any of the other three options (linear, poly, sigmoid). You can also test what happens when you make changes to the other parameters, e.g. degree, gamma or coef0 which impact the shape of the boundaries. Remember that AUC is a pure comparison metric - we use it to evaluate different models against each other, and a higher AUC indicates a better performance.\n"

    "Think back to the lecture: There are two main decisions you have to make for an SVM. One is the Kernel choice, which we have just covered. The other is the parameter C.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Check what happens when you decrese or increase the value for C for your best performing SVC from tasks 1.2 and 1.3. You can choose a number of different values (higher and lower than the default 1) and compare based on accuracy and/or AUC."
