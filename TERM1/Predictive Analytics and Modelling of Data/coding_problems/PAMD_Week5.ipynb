But the arrays in the beginning without the seed will change every time. This is because you use a certain stream of previously generated random numbers that are kept in an array, saved via this \"passcode\" seed. In other words, the random samples generated by seed is traceable.\n",

    "In general, to make our sampling appear to be random, as we theorise it should be, we use a computer to generate a random number, or an array of random numbers, depending on the application. Computers do this by making use of **pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs)**. These generators start from a particular state, the (random) seed state, and start to apply different functions/algorithms over that seed to obtain the next results in the sequence. Many such functions exist. The one used in numpy for example is based on the very popular Mersenne Twister PRNG (it is also used in Excel, R, MATLAB, and so on).\n",

    "Now you see why, **when we set the seed, we obtain the same results. We are applying the same function to the same starting point so all the subsequent results can be derived by applying the same function. If we don't set the seed in Python, the initial seed value gets reseeded after every generation, i.e., it is replaced by another value from a pseudo-random sequence every time we run the code that is asked to make a selection.**\n"
