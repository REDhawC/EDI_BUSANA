Also can you formulate a clear answer to the question you created?\n",

    "\n",
    "**C) Visualisation:** Can you aid your argument/aswer with visual clues? Graph can say a thousand words, but it is also easy to make one which is confusing, or misleading. Use simple (or highly customised) graphs to make your argument clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**D) Code Quality:** Is your code clean, readable and DRY (Don't repeat yourself)? Are you using good readable variable names? Did you clean up your code and does it not include enay old/unused parts?\n",
    "\n",
    "**E) Code Structure:** Is your code well structured and broken down? Just like good writing has sentences, paragraphs and chapters, good code should be split into sections. Breakdown your code into cells and functions. Use meaningful signposts (eg. comments, function names) to guide the reader through your code.\n",

    "The Covid-19 pandemic, has had a significant impact on individuals and community health. While some effects have lessened, long-term health issues still persist. We examined Covid-19 data in whole Scotland over two years, starting in 2020, to assess any correlation with lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key data, including \"covid_days\" and \"cancer_waiting_time,\" were used to group Covid-19 and lung cancer cases by quarter. We created two charts to depict the relationship between lung cancer cases and initial Covid-19 infections, as well as the number of positive Covid-19 cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The charts show that from Q2 2020 to Q3 2021, Covid-19 cases fluctuated in an upward trend, with a sharp increase in Q3 2021. Meanwhile, lung cancer cases remained relatively stable. However, in Q4 2021, there was a significant surge in Covid-19 cases, otaling around 400,000 cases, coinciding with the highest number of lung cancer cases in two years, surpassing 1000 cases in Scotland. This suggests a potential link between the two, warranting further investigation."
